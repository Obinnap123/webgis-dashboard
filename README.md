# TicketHub - Enterprise Service Request Management System

> **A professional, production-ready SaaS dashboard for managing service requests and tickets at scale**

## í¾¯ The Problem We're Solving

**Organizations struggle with fragmented service request management:**

- âŒ Support teams using email for ticket tracking (loses context, creates duplicates)
- âŒ No visibility into ticket status, priorities, and resolution times
- âŒ Lack of accountability - hard to track who did what and when
- âŒ No real-time analytics to identify bottlenecks
- âŒ Manual role management leading to security and oversight issues
- âŒ Scattered information across multiple tools and spreadsheets

**TicketHub solves this by providing:**
âœ… Centralized ticket management with full lifecycle tracking
âœ… Real-time dashboard with actionable insights
âœ… Role-based access control for team security
âœ… Complete audit trail of all changes
âœ… Advanced filtering and search capabilities
âœ… Professional SaaS interface that teams actually want to use

```

### User Flow

**1. Authentication & Authorization**
```
User Login (email/password)
    â†“
NextAuth CredentialsProvider validates credentials
    â†“
Prisma queries User table (email check)
    â†“
bcrypt compares password securely
    â†“
JWT token generated (30-day expiration)
    â†“
Session created with role included
    â†“
User redirected to Dashboard
```

**2. Ticket Creation & Management**
```
Staff/Admin clicks "New Ticket"
    â†“
Form submission with title, description, priority
    â†“
API validates input (TypeScript types)
    â†“
Prisma creates Ticket in database
    â†“
Activity log auto-created for audit trail
    â†“
Redirect to ticket detail page
    â†“
User can update status, priority, assignment
    â†“
Each change logged to Activity table
```

**3. Role-Based Access Control**
```
Every API request checked for:
â”œâ”€ Is user authenticated? (JWT token valid)
â”œâ”€ Does request require specific role? (Admin/Staff)
â”œâ”€ Is user authorized? (role matches requirement)
â””â”€ Log the action in Activity table
```

### Data Models

**User**
```
- id (UUID)
- email (unique)
- name
- password (bcrypt hashed)
- role (ADMIN | STAFF)
- isActive (boolean)
- createdAt, updatedAt
â”œâ”€ Relations: Created Tickets, Assigned Tickets, Activities
```

**Ticket**
```
- id (UUID)
- title, description
- status (OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | RESOLVED | CLOSED)
- priority (LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | URGENT)
- createdBy (User reference)
- assignedTo (User reference, optional)
- createdAt, updatedAt, resolvedAt
â”œâ”€ Relations: Creator, Assignee, Activity logs
```

**Activity (Audit Trail)**
```
- id (UUID)
- ticket (Ticket reference)
- user (User reference)
- action (created, assigned, status_changed, etc)
- previousValue, newValue (for tracking changes)
- createdAt
â”œâ”€ Relations: Ticket, User
```
